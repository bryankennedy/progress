# Progress — Reference

The system **as built** (milestones 1–5, 2026-06-11/12). Information-oriented
and present tense throughout; if it's described here, it works today. For
vision and unbuilt work see [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md); for rationale see
[`DECISIONS.md`](./DECISIONS.md) (D-numbers below refer to its entries).

## 1. Stack & layout

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Hosting | Cloudflare Workers (single Worker: API + static assets) — production at <https://progress.bck.dev>, D1 `progress-db` (ENAM) |
| API | Hono (TypeScript, ESM) |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) via Drizzle ORM; local D1 under `.wrangler/state/` |
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite + Tailwind 4 |
| Client state | TanStack Query, whole workspace in one cache entry (D21) |
| Routing | wouter (D22) |
| Drag & drop | @dnd-kit/core + @dnd-kit/sortable (D23, D44) |
| Markdown | react-markdown + hand-rolled `.prose-lite` styles |

| `src/shared/` | Wire types (`types.ts`) and fixed vocabularies (`constants.ts`) shared client/server |
| `src/db/schema.ts` | Drizzle schema — single schema source of truth, generates `drizzle/` migrations |
| `src/mcp/server.ts` | Progress MCP server — local stdio client of the API (D34) |
| `bin/progress.ts` | `progress work <KEY>` kickoff CLI — bundle → branch → `claude` (D35) |
| `scripts/` | `seed.sql` (idempotent baseline), `seed-scale.ts` (5k-issue synthetic workspace) |

```

| Entity | Parent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Initiative | — | Portfolio-level theme grouping products. |
| Product | Initiative | The central unit; carries the issue-key prefix (`keyPrefix`, 2–8 letters, globally unique, editable) and the per-product issue-number sequence (`nextIssueNumber`). |
| Repo | Product | Sub-container mirroring a real git repository (`gitUrl`, optional until connected). |
| Arc | Product | Epic-like grouping of issues from anywhere under its product. (The words "epic" and "project" are banned.) |
| Issue | Product *or* Repo | The atomic unit. `productId` always set; nullable `repoId` narrows the container (D17). Optional `arcId`, same-product enforced. |
| Tag | — (global) | Name + auto-color (stable hash into a fixed 7-color palette, D27). |

### Containment & movement rules (as enforced)

- An issue's container is a product or one of that product's repos — never
  both, never neither. Repo-in-product and arc-in-product invariants are
  API-enforced (SQLite can't express them cheaply).
- Issues move freely between containers. **Within a product**: the key and
  arc survive; only `repoId` changes. **Across products**: the issue is
  re-keyed from the target's sequence, its arc is cleared, and the old key
  is written to `issue_key_aliases` as a permanent redirect (D18, D24).
- Issue keys are **derived, never stored**: `product.keyPrefix + "-" +
  issue.number`. Renaming a prefix re-keys everything consistently; alias
  rows store retired keys verbatim so they survive renames too.
- **Archive, no hard deletes** — all four container types carry
  `archivedAt`. Archived containers leave board filters, creation targets,
  move targets, and palette search; their issues stay visible everywhere;
  parent pages list them dimmed so unarchive stays reachable (D26).

### Issue anatomy

| Field | Values |
|---|---|
| Key | `PREFIX-n`, derived (see above) |
| Title, Description | text / Markdown, both inline-editable |
| Status | `backlog` · `todo` · `in_progress` · `in_review` · `done` · `canceled` — fixed global set |
| Priority | `urgent` · `high` · `medium` · `low` · `none` (default `none`) |
| Estimate | 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 8 points, or null |
| Due date | Optional calendar day, ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` (timezone-safe, not an instant); drives the Agenda (D37) |
| Board order | `rank` — a fractional-index key (`src/shared/rank.ts`) giving each card a manual vertical position in its column; drag a card above/below another. Always set; one-row reorder, no renumbering (D44) |
| Tags | 0..n global tags |
| Arc | 0..1, same product |
| Parent issue | 0..1 `parentIssueId`, same product, acyclic — makes this issue a sub-issue, nestable to any depth (PROG-124). API-enforced; a cross-product move clears it and detaches children |
| Comments + Activity | Markdown thread interleaved with append-only events into one timeline |
| Timestamps | `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `completedAt` (set iff status is `done`) |
| Creator / assignee | user references (one `usr_owner` row in v1; schema is multi-user-ready, D13) |

Fixed vocabularies live in `src/shared/constants.ts` and are shared verbatim
by schema, API validation, and client.

### Data conventions (D19)

- IDs: app-generated text with type prefixes — `usr_ ini_ prd_ rep_ arc_
  iss_ tag_ cmt_ act_` — identifiable on sight in URLs and logs.
- Container and tag ids may be **client-generated** (the store creates rows
  optimistically and navigates immediately; the server accepts well-formed
  ids verbatim, D26).
- Timestamps: unix-epoch integers set by the API, never DB defaults. The
  exception is `issues.due_date` (D37): a **calendar day** stored as ISO
  `YYYY-MM-DD` text, identical in every timezone — deliberately not an instant.
- Activity rows are append-only; `data` carries the event payload. Current
  event types: `status_changed` `{from, to}`, `moved` `{fromProductId,
  fromRepoId, toProductId, toRepoId, fromKey?, toKey?}` (keys present only
  on cross-product moves), `pr_linked` `{githubRepo, prNumber, title, url,
  state}`, `commit_linked` `{githubRepo, sha, message, url, branch}`.

### Git links (D29)

Two tables, written only by the GitHub webhook: `pr_links` (PK `issueId +
githubRepo + prNumber`; mutable `state` open/merged/closed and `title`) and
`commit_links` (PK `issueId + sha`; immutable, message stored as subject
line only). `githubRepo` is `"owner/name"` text, deliberately **not** an FK
to `repos` — links survive container renames/archives and can arrive from
repos that aren't containers here. Composite PKs double as the idempotency
guard for webhook redeliveries. Links are permanent: editing the mention
away later does not unlink.

## 3. API

All routes are JSON under `/api`. Errors are `{ error: string }` with 400
(validation), 401 (unauthenticated), 403 (not on the sign-in allowlist), 404
(missing), or 409 (key-prefix conflict). Any uncaught handler error is caught by
a top-level `app.onError`: it logs the real exception (`console.error`, visible
in `wrangler tail`) and returns a generic `{ error: "internal_error" }` 500 —
generic on purpose, since the webhook path is publicly reachable (D31).

### Authentication (PROG-34, supersedes D12)

The Worker owns auth: in-app **Google OAuth** mints a stateless signed session
cookie, and a middleware on `/api/*` resolves identity per request — exempting
`/api/health`, `/api/auth/*`, and `/api/webhooks/*`. Order: an
`Authorization: Bearer <PROGRESS_API_TOKEN>` header (non-interactive clients →
`usr_owner`); else a valid `progress_session` cookie; else, **when the OAuth
secrets are unset _and_ the request is to a loopback origin** (local dev), a
fallback to `usr_owner` so `bun run dev` and tests never hit a login wall; else
`401`. The loopback condition makes the fallback fail **closed**: a deployed
origin with unconfigured auth returns `401` rather than silently serving the API
as the owner. Every write is attributed to the
resolved user (`c.get("userId")` → `creatorId`/`assigneeId`/`authorId`/
`actorId`); the webhook, having no interactive user, still writes as `usr_owner`.
Sign-in is gated two ways (D44): **super-admins** (the `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS`
secret) are always allowed and manage everyone else via the **Admin** page
(`/admin`); other users must have a row in the D1 `allowed_emails` table. The
check `super-admin OR allowlisted` runs at the OAuth callback **and** on every
`/api/*` request, so removing someone revokes their live session within seconds
(the middleware drops the cookie and returns `401`). Admin CRUD lives at
`/api/admin/allowlist` gated on a per-request `isSuperAdmin` flag; `/api/workspace`
ships `isSuperAdmin` + the `allowedEmails` list to super-admins only.
Auth routes: `GET /api/auth/login` (302 → Google, sets a signed state cookie),
`GET /api/auth/callback` (verify state, exchange code, require a Google-**verified**
email, allowlist-check, upsert user by email, set session cookie, 302 → `/`),
`POST /api/auth/logout`. See
`src/worker/auth.ts`. Client-side, a `401` from `GET /api/workspace` surfaces as
an `UnauthenticatedError` that renders the **sign-in landing page**
(`SignIn.tsx`, §5) — a brand mark and a "Sign in with Google" button linking to
`/api/auth/login` — rather than auto-redirecting.

### Observability

Every request is tagged with a `requestId` (Cloudflare's `cf-ray` in prod, a
uuid locally), echoed as the `x-request-id` response header. The Worker logs
**structured JSON** (`src/worker/log.ts`): a `request` access line per `/api/*`
call (`method`/`path`/`status`/`durationMs`, excluding `/api/health`) and error
events (`unhandled_error`, `oauth_callback_failed`, `health_d1_probe_failed`)
carrying the same `requestId`. `observability` is enabled in `wrangler.jsonc`, so
the logs are queryable in the dashboard. Operational detail — tailing, querying,
and alert setup — is in `docs/SETUP.md` §6.

### Security headers (PROG-65)

Two complementary layers, because the Worker only runs for `/api/*`
(`run_worker_first`) while the SPA document, JS, CSS, and fonts are served
straight from Cloudflare's asset handler:

- **`public/_headers`** (ships to the asset root) carries the full set for the
  statically-served app, including a **Content-Security-Policy** tuned to exactly
  what `index.html` loads — `script-src 'self'`, `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
  https://fonts.googleapis.com` (inline styles cover React `style={}` + dnd-kit
  drag transforms), `font-src` Google Fonts, `img-src 'self' data: blob:`,
  `connect-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`,
  `base-uri 'self'`.
- A Worker `app.use("*")` middleware sets `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and HSTS on everything
  the Worker serves — the `/api/*` JSON, the **image blobs** (so a client-asserted
  upload `Content-Type` can't be MIME-sniffed into something executable), and the
  not-authorized page. CSP is intentionally *not* set here (the not-authorized
  page uses inline styles + Google Fonts; JSON needs none).

Both layers also carry HSTS. The single-tenant trust model is deliberate: any
allowlisted user (or the bearer token) can read all workspace data and all images
— there is no per-resource ownership check, because every allowlisted account is
trusted (D44). `gitUrl` is validated server-side as an `http(s)` URL on
`POST`/`PATCH /api/repos`, so a `javascript:` value can't reach the client as a
clickable link.

Vulnerability disclosure: a `SECURITY.md` at the repo root and an RFC 9116
`public/.well-known/security.txt` (served at `/.well-known/security.txt`) point
reporters at the contact + policy. The `security.txt` `Expires` field is
mandatory — renew it before it lapses (an expired file is worse than none).

### Workspace & issues

| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Readiness probe: round-trips D1 (`select 1`). `{ ok: true, db: "ok" }` (200) when reachable, `{ ok: false, db: "error" }` (503) when not — so it reflects database reachability, not just that the Worker booted. The only `/api/*` route never access-logged. |
| `GET /api/workspace` | The load-everything payload: `me` (the signed-in user, PROG-34), users, initiatives, products, repos, arcs, issues, tags, issueTags, issueKeyAliases — nine independent reads run with `Promise.all` (not a `db.batch`/transaction, which 500'd on production D1; D31). Comments/activity are deliberately excluded (D20). |
| `POST /api/issues` | `{ title, productId, repoId?, arcId?, parentIssueId?, description?, status?, priority?, estimate?, dueDate? }` → 201 `{ issue }`. `dueDate` is `YYYY-MM-DD` or null, validated (impossible dates rejected). `parentIssueId` must be an existing issue in the same product (PROG-124). Number allocated by atomic increment of the product sequence; gaps from failed creates are harmless (D24). A board `rank` is auto-assigned, appended after the current last issue (D44). |
| `PATCH /api/issues/:id` | Any of `title, description, status, priority, estimate, arcId, parentIssueId, dueDate, rank` — validated per field; arc and parent must be same-product; `parentIssueId` reparent is acyclic and not self (PROG-124); `dueDate`/`arcId`/`parentIssueId` accept null to clear. `rank` is a fractional-index board key the client computes from the drop site's neighbors (D44). A status change atomically appends a `status_changed` activity row and maintains `completedAt`. |
| `POST /api/issues/:id/move` | `{ productId, repoId }` (`repoId: null` = product-level). Within-product keeps key + arc; cross-product re-keys, clears arc, writes the alias, logs `moved`. 400 on no-op. |
| `GET /api/issues/:id/timeline` | `{ comments, activity, pullRequests, commits }`, each ordered by `createdAt`. |
| `GET /api/issues/:key/bundle` | Looked up by **key** (alias-aware), not id. Returns `text/markdown` — a deterministic context "work order": issue fields + tags, lineage with descriptions (product → repo incl. `gitUrl` → arc, where the arc description carries the "why"), comments, an **Images** list (absolute URLs of every image referenced in the description/comments, so a bearer-authed agent can fetch them — PROG-42), linked PRs/commits, then a stable report-back preamble — branch/key auto-linking + status flow, plus a **Committing & PRs** block that embeds a local, key-aware copy of the owner's smart-commit conventions (logical chunks, secret-scan, `type(scope): KEY subject`, no AI attribution) so a handed-off agent commits to the owner's rules (PROG-62). A retired key resolves and renders the current canonical key. 400 malformed key, 404 unknown. Rendered by `src/worker/bundle.ts` (`renderBundle`); shared foundation for the agent surfaces (SPEC §11.1, D33). |
| `GET /api/arcs/:id/bundle` | Looked up by **id** (the arc page has it). Returns `text/markdown` — the **arc** work order: a single prompt covering **every open issue** in the arc (`done`/`canceled` dropped via `isOpenStatus`), each rendered like the issue bundle (fields, description, comments, Images, linked PRs/commits) minus its per-issue footer, with product/arc lineage stated once and repo per-issue. Ends in **combined-PR** orchestration — fan the issues to sub-agents, share one branch, land **one PR naming every key** — plus the same smart-commit block (keyed per-commit). Deterministic (status-then-number sort). 404 unknown arc. Rendered by `renderArcBundle` in `src/worker/bundle.ts`. |
| `POST /api/issues/:id/comments` | `{ body }` → 201 `{ comment }`. |
| `GET /api/search?q=` | Comment full-text search (PROG-130) — the one searchable text not in the workspace payload (D20), so it needs the server; title/description search runs client-side over the store. Case-insensitive substring via SQLite `LIKE`, AND'd across whitespace terms, wildcards escaped (`ESCAPE '\'`) so `100%` matches literally. Returns `{ hits: [{ commentId, issueId, snippet }], truncated }`, most-recent first, capped at 50 (`truncated` true when more exist). The client resolves `issueId` to the issue it already holds; `snippet` is a body window the client re-highlights. Pure helpers in `src/worker/searchComments.ts`. |

### Images (PROG-42)

Pasted/uploaded images live in the R2 bucket bound as `IMAGES`; a D1 `images`
row authorizes and attributes each. Both routes sit behind the `/api/*` auth
gate, so an image is viewable by any signed-in (allowlisted) user or the bearer
token — never the public internet.

| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/images` | Raw image bytes as the body (`Content-Type` = the image type). Validates type (png/jpeg/gif/webp/avif) + size (≤10 MB), stores to R2, records the row → 201 `{ image: { id, url } }` where `url` is `/api/images/<id>`. |
| `GET /api/images/:id` | Streams the blob with an immutable cache header. `?w=<px>` returns an edge-resized variant via a `cf.image` subrequest **in production**; locally / off-edge / with resizing disabled it streams the original (graceful fallback). `?raw=1` always streams the original. |

Descriptions/comments reference images as `/api/images/<id>` markdown; the shared
`Markdown` renderer requests a `?w=` display variant and links to the original,
and `MarkdownTextarea` handles paste + the "+ Image" button in both editors.

### Tags

| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/issues/:id/tags` | `{ tagId }` assigns an existing tag; `{ name, id? }` creates-or-gets by name (auto-color) then assigns — one atomic call (D27). Link insert is idempotent. → 201 `{ tag, link }`. |
| `DELETE /api/issues/:id/tags/:tagId` | Unlinks. Tag rows are never deleted. |

### Containers (D26)

| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/initiatives` | `{ id?, name, description? }` |
| `POST /api/products` | `{ id?, name, initiativeId, keyPrefix, description? }` — prefix validated `^[A-Z]{2,8}$` (uppercased), 409 if taken |
| `POST /api/repos` | `{ id?, name, productId, gitUrl?, description? }` |
| `POST /api/arcs` | `{ id?, name, productId, description? }` |
| `PATCH /api/<type>/:id` | `{ name?, description?, archived? }` for all four; plus `keyPrefix?` (products), `gitUrl?` (repos). `archived: boolean` maps to `archivedAt`. |

All return `{ container }`; creates return 201.

### GitHub webhook (D29)

`POST /api/webhooks/github` — authenticated by GitHub's
`X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC (SHA-256 over the raw body, constant-time
compare) against the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` binding (local: `.dev.vars`;
production: `wrangler secret put`). 503 when unconfigured, 401 on a bad
signature; unhandled events are acknowledged with `{ ok, ignored }`.

Magic words: candidates matching `\b[A-Za-z]{2,8}-\d+\b` are resolved
against current issue keys first, then retired alias keys; unknown prefixes
simply don't resolve (so prose like "UTF-8" can't false-positive).

- **`push`**: keys in the branch name link every commit in the push; keys
  in a commit message link that commit. New links append `commit_linked`
  activity; redeliveries are no-ops.
- **`pull_request`**: keys in the title, body, or source-branch name link
  the PR. First sight inserts the link + `pr_linked` activity; later events
  (edit/close/merge/reopen) update title and state in place, silently.
  GitHub's closed+merged flag is normalized to the `merged` state.

### MCP server (D34)

`src/mcp/server.ts` (`bun run mcp`) is a **local stdio MCP server** that wraps
this API rather than re-implementing the domain — the Worker stays the single
source of truth. It authenticates with the **`PROGRESS_API_TOKEN`** bearer
(or the `PROD_PROGRESS_API_TOKEN` fallback) via the `Authorization: Bearer`
header, the same non-interactive pattern the dogfood scripts and `progress work`
CLI use (SPEC §11.3/§11.4, PROG-34). Registration: SETUP §7.

Tools are **key-addressed** (alias-aware) and validated against the shared
vocabularies in `src/shared/constants.ts`:

| Tool | Wraps |
|---|---|
| `get_bundle` | `GET /api/issues/:key/bundle` — the Markdown work order |
| `get_issue` | one issue as structured JSON (fields + lineage names + tags) |
| `list_issues` | filters `GET /api/workspace` in-process: `status, productKey, repo, arc, tag, query, limit` (AND-combined; default limit 50) |
| `create_issue` | `POST /api/issues` (arc/repo by name, resolved within the product; optional `dueDate`) |
| `update_status` | `PATCH /api/issues/:id` `{ status }` |
| `set_due_date` | `PATCH /api/issues/:id` `{ dueDate }` — set a `YYYY-MM-DD` day or clear with null |
| `comment` | `POST /api/issues/:id/comments` |
| `move_issue` | `POST /api/issues/:id/move` (destination product by key) |

Key→id resolution and name lookups run off one `/api/workspace` snapshot per
call, mirroring the Worker's own alias-aware resolution (retired keys resolve;
results report the current canonical key).

### Work-on-this kickoff (D35)

Two ways to hand an issue's bundle to a Claude Code session (SPEC §11.2):

- **In-app** — the issue page's **Work on this** field and the `W` palette
  command (`src/client/workOn.ts`) copy either the bundle Markdown ("Copy as
  prompt") or the `progress work <KEY>` CLI line. The bundle is fetched from
  `GET /api/issues/:key/bundle` and prefetched on issue load so the copy is
  instant (no spinner; SPEC §8.2).
- **CLI** — `bin/progress.ts` (`progress work <KEY>`): fetches the bundle with
  the `PROGRESS_API_TOKEN` bearer, creates/checks out `iss/<KEY>` (branch-from-key, so
  later commits/PRs auto-link via §5), then launches `claude` primed with the
  bundle as its opening prompt — all in the current directory, so Progress
  never needs to know where repos live. Flags: `--no-branch`, `--print`.
  Registration: SETUP §7.

The **arc page** has a sibling **Copy arc as prompt** action (the Issues
toolbar) that copies one prompt covering every open issue in the arc, ending in
combined-PR / sub-agent orchestration — `copyArcBundleAsPrompt` in
`src/client/workOn.ts`, fetched from `GET /api/arcs/:id/bundle` and prefetched on
arc-page load. In-app only for now (no CLI/MCP arc kickoff yet).

## 4. Client architecture

### The store (`src/client/store.ts`)

- One TanStack Query cache entry `['workspace']` holds the entire workspace,
  fetched once with `staleTime: Infinity` — this client is the only writer,
  so nothing goes stale on its own (D21). Components subscribe to slices via
  `useWorkspaceSlice`; structural sharing keeps re-renders scoped.
- Per-issue timelines are separate `['issue', id, 'timeline']` queries,
  loaded when an issue page opens and invalidated by mutations that append
  activity.
- **Every mutation is optimistic** (SPEC §8.2 is a hard requirement): write
  the cache synchronously, sync in the background, and on failure restore
  exactly the touched state and raise a toast. No interaction ever waits on
  the server:
  - Field updates snapshot/restore the one issue or container.
  - **Creates allocate identity locally** — issue numbers from the store's
    `nextIssueNumber` mirror, container/tag ids generated client-side — so
    navigation to the new entity is instant and survives reconciliation
    with the server row.
  - **Moves** mirror the full server semantics locally, including the
    cross-product re-key and alias append, so an open issue page redirects
    to its canonical key with no round trip.

### Routing & key resolution

Routes: `/` (board), `/outline` (the capture outliner), `/agenda` (the
due-date view), `/structure` (the container tree), `/archive` (completed arcs),
`/issue/:key`, `/initiative/:id`, `/product/:id`, `/repo/:id`, `/arc/:id`. Issue URLs are key-based; `findIssueByKey` resolves
current keys first, then alias keys with a `replaceState` redirect to the
canonical key — entirely client-side from the loaded workspace (D22).

## 5. UI surfaces

- **Sign-in landing (`SignIn.tsx`)** — the only screen rendered without a loaded
  workspace (on a `401`, PROG-34): centered brand mark, "Progress" wordmark, and
  a single **Sign in with Google** link to `/api/auth/login`. No header, no store
  access. In local dev the Worker falls back to the owner, so this appears only
  when OAuth is configured (production).
- **Outline (`/outline`, PROG-124)** — a Workflowy-style outliner for fast
  keyboard capture of issues as nested bullets (`src/client/pages/Outline.tsx`).
  A scope picker selects an Initiative or Product (URL `?product=`/`?initiative=`)
  and sets the ceiling. A fresh bullet is always an Issue; the trailing "+ new
  bullet" captures continuously (Enter adds a sibling and keeps focus, Tab nests
  it under the last sibling as a sub-issue, Shift+Tab outdents). Existing rows
  rename on Enter/blur and reparent in place via Tab/Shift+Tab. Arcs are reached
  only by the explicit per-row "→ arc" control (pick existing or create new);
  a per-row three-dot link in a fixed **far-left** gutter opens the full issue —
  always visible on mobile (tappable, no hover needed) and faint-until-hover on
  desktop (PROG-80). Nothing here deletes or archives. All writes
  reuse the optimistic `createIssue`/`updateIssue`/`createContainer` paths.
  Completed issues (done/canceled) read as finished — dimmed + struck through —
  and a page-level **Hide done** toggle drops them (and their subtrees) from the
  forest entirely. That toggle is a sticky per-user preference, persisted to
  `localStorage` so it survives leaving and returning to the route
  (`src/client/outlinePrefs.ts`, PROG-77).
- **Search (`/` modal + `/search` page, PROG-130)** — two surfaces sharing one
  two-wave model. Title/description hits come from the in-memory store and paint
  instantly; comment hits need a server round-trip (`GET /api/search`, D20) and
  stream into their own section a beat later, ranked below the local hits.
  Matching is case-insensitive substring; ranking weights title over description
  (`src/client/search.ts`, unit-tested). The **`/` modal** (`SearchModal.tsx`,
  separate from the ⌘K palette by design) is for quick jump — Issues, then
  Containers, then Comments, with matched terms highlighted; Enter opens the
  selection, and a footer link hands the query to the page. The **`/search`
  page** (`pages/Search.tsx`) is the deep dive: the same results, filterable by
  the board dimensions (status · product · arc · repo · tag · priority) — Arc,
  Repo, and Tag share the board's **"none"** option for issues with no value
  there (PROG-76) — with query + filters in the URL so a search is bookmarkable.
  The filter dropdown itself (`FilterSelect.tsx`) is shared with the board.
- **App header** — persistent across pages: the "Progress" home link, nav
  (Board · Outline · Agenda · Search · Structure · Archive), a **New** menu (Issue ·
  Initiative · Product · Repo · Arc) that opens the existing optimistic create flows, and the
  signed-in identity avatar. The always-available structure-creation entry point
  (SPEC v2 §4). The avatar dropdown holds the profile + **Sign out**, plus an
  **Admin** link for super-admins (D44) — Admin lives here, not in the top nav,
  as a rare destination. The inline nav is **desktop-only**: below `sm` it is
  hidden and a fixed **bottom tab bar** (`MobileTabBar.tsx`) takes over — Board ·
  Outline · Agenda · Search as tabs and a **More** tab (sheet) for Structure ·
  Archive, the active tab lit in the adobe accent (More included when its sheet's
  page is current), clear of the iOS home indicator. This stops the header from
  overflowing and scrolling sideways on a phone (PROG-79). Both surfaces read
  their destinations from one shared `nav.tsx` list so they can't drift.
- **Agenda (`/agenda`)** — the time-driven cut: every issue with a due date
  that isn't done/canceled, sorted by due date ascending and grouped **Overdue ·
  Today · This week · Later** (computed from the owner's local day; "this week"
  is a rolling 7 days, D38). Each row carries the **priority indicator** (§7.2 /
  D39, redesigned as on-palette signal bars in D47 — one reusable
  `PriorityIndicator` shared by the board card, issue page, and container lists),
  key, title, the due date as a relative phrase ("in 3 days"), product/arc
  and status; overdue rows are visually distinct. Filterable by product/arc/tag
  via URL params (the board pattern), with inline mark-done and bump-due. Renders
  entirely from the store.
- **Structure (`/structure`)** — the Initiative → Product → (Repo · Arc) tree
  with an inline "+ add" on each node (D40); a dedicated home for curating
  structure that keeps the board uncluttered. Active arcs always show; archived
  (completed) arcs render crossed-out but are capped at the first 5 per product,
  with a "+N more in Archive →" link to `/archive` once they pile up beyond that
  (`capArchived`, PROG-45).
- **Archive (`/archive`)** — a top-nav destination listing every archived arc,
  grouped by Initiative → Product (mirroring the Structure tree). Also reached
  from Structure's "+N more" link; unarchiving still happens on the arc page
  (PROG-45).
- **Board (`/`)** — the global "My Work" kanban. Columns are the fixed
  statuses; Backlog hides behind a toggle by default. Filters (initiative,
  product, repo, arc, tag, priority) live in URL query params, so any
  filtered board is bookmarkable — this is how per-container boards are
  covered without existing (D23). Name-based filter dropdowns (initiative,
  product, repo, arc, tag) list their options alphabetically; priority keeps
  its logical order (PROG-66). The filters are hierarchy-aware (Initiative →
  Product → Arc/Repo): each dropdown only offers options reachable from the
  ancestors already chosen, and changing an ancestor prunes any now-stranded
  descendant from the URL in the same write, so an impossible combination that
  matches nothing can't be selected (`pruneImpossibleFilters`, PROG-75). The
  nullable filters — Arc, Repo, Tag — each also offer a **"none"** option
  (URL sentinel `?arc=none`, `matchesNullableId`) to find issues with no value
  there; it sits outside the hierarchy, so it's always offered and never pruned
  (PROG-76). The
  Agenda filters sort the same way. The current filter selection is also
  mirrored to `localStorage` (`progress:board-filters`) and re-applied when the
  board is reopened with a bare URL, so a choice sticks across navigation;
  "Clear filters" clears the memory too (PROG-58). On phones (`< sm`) the whole
  filter row collapses behind a **"Filters"** disclosure — collapsed by default,
  with a badge counting the active filters/toggles — so the board itself sits
  above the fold instead of a screenful of dropdowns; at `sm` and up the row is
  always inline (PROG-81). Drag-and-drop reorders cards
  vertically
  within a column (a manual work order) and moves them between columns to set
  status; both persist as one optimistic write via the card's `rank` (D44).
  Mouse drags activate after 4px of movement (plain clicks navigate), touch
  drags after a 250ms press-and-hold (plain swipes scroll the board) — D30. When
  the columns overflow (a phone, where they hit their `min-w-72` floor) the row
  is **scroll-snap x-mandatory** with each column a `snap-start` point, so a
  horizontal swipe always settles with a column pinned to the left edge — each
  column is a "home" for the scroll. Snap is a no-op on desktop (columns fit, no
  overflow) and is suppressed mid-drag so it can't fight the card-drag edge
  auto-scroll (PROG-47/48). All columns render at one shared height, so a card
  can be dropped into any column's full-height zone without dragging to its top. The **Done** column is
  capped to the 10 most-recently-completed issues (by `completedAt`) so it can't
  grow without bound; its header reads "Done · 10 of N" when older ones are
  hidden (they stay reachable via search, Agenda, and container pages) — PROG-40.
  Each **card** pairs its two at-a-glance signals in a footer: the **due date**
  (if any) sits bottom-left as a calendar glyph + the Agenda's phrasing ("in 3
  days · Jul 1", overdue in danger red, due-today in the adobe accent), and the
  **priority indicator** floats to the bottom-right corner (PROG-61). Estimate
  and tags sit on their own line above the footer so they don't crowd it.
  A **"show sub-issues"** toggle (URL `?subissues=1`, off by default) controls
  whether child issues appear: off keeps one card per top-level deliverable; on
  surfaces sub-issues with a nested style — indented, a moss accent rail, and a
  "↳ PARENT-KEY" breadcrumb (PROG-124). Columns still sort everything by `rank`.
- **Container pages** — description-on-top open page (inline-editable name,
  Markdown description, key prefix / git URL where applicable, archive
  toggle), child-container chips with "+ New" buttons, and a
  sortable/filterable issue list with inline status/priority edits.
- **Issue page** — inline-editable title and description, sidebar fields
  (status/priority/estimate selects; container, arc, and tags with picker
  buttons; a **Work on this** field — D35), a Git section (linked PRs with
  state badges, commits with short shas, linking out to GitHub), and comments
  + activity interleaved into one timeline.
- **Command palette** — one keyboard surface (D25): root mode searches
  issues by key (retired alias keys included) or title and containers by
  name, and lists commands (create issue/initiative/product/repo/arc,
  pickers for the current issue). Picker modes are filterable lists; tag
  toggles keep the palette open for multi-edit.
- **Create dialogs** — issue and container creation; parents/containers
  default from the current view (open container page, viewed issue's
  container, or active board filters). New issues default to **Todo** so
  they're visible on the default board, and carry an optional **due date**. The
  issue dialog offers inline **"+ New product / + New arc"** so structure can be
  spun up without leaving the flow (SPEC v2 §4).

### Keyboard map (D25, D27)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` | Command palette |
| `/` | Search modal (PROG-130) — separate from the palette; title/description hits paint instantly, comment hits stream in |
| `C` | Create issue |
| `S` / `P` / `E` | Status / priority / estimate picker for the current issue |
| `M` / `A` / `T` | Move / arc / tag picker for the current issue |
| `D` | Due-date picker for the current issue (relative quick-picks or a typed `YYYY-MM-DD`; clear) |
| `W` | Work on this — copy the bundle as a prompt or the `progress work` CLI line (D35) |
| `↑↓`, `Enter`, `Esc`, `Backspace` | Navigate / run / close / back-to-root inside the palette |

"Current issue" = the issue page's issue, or the card/row under the pointer
or keyboard focus on boards and lists (tracked via `data-issue-id`
delegation). Plain keys are suppressed while typing in any input.

## 6. Performance baseline

The architecture was validated by a latency spike before adoption (D21):
5,000-issue synthetic workspace, 100 real DOM clicks in headless Chromium —
TanStack Query at 23 ms p50 / 98 ms p95 click-to-paint on the worst-case
all-columns board. Regenerate the dataset with `bun run db:seed:scale`.
