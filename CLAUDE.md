# Progress

A single-user, web-based product-development tracker (a "personal Linear" with
the owner's own hierarchy: Initiative → Product → Repo/Arc → Issue).

## Documents — read before non-trivial work

Organized per Diátaxis (map: `docs/README.md`). Built vs. planned is split
deliberately — keep it that way as milestones land:

- `docs/REFERENCE.md` — the system **as built** (domain rules, API, client
  architecture, keyboard map). Present tense; update it when shipping.
- `docs/SPEC.md` — vision, principles, and the **not-yet-built** roadmap.
  Source of truth for scope of remaining work. Section numbers are stable
  (code comments cite them); when an area ships, shrink its section to a
  pointer into REFERENCE rather than renumbering.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — append-only decision log. Settled questions live here;
  don't re-litigate them — supersede with a new entry if something changes.
- `docs/SETUP.md` — how-to: install, run, schema changes, deploy.

When a decision of consequence is made in conversation, record it in
`docs/DECISIONS.md` in the same session.

## Hard requirements (never trade away)

1. **Instant UI.** Whole workspace loads into a client store; all mutations are
   optimistic; a spinner on user interaction is a bug. See SPEC §8.2.
2. **The owner's nouns.** Initiative, Product, Repo, Arc, Issue. Never "epic",
   never "project" (as an entity name).
3. **Rigid simplicity.** Fixed status set, no configurable workflows.

## Stack & conventions

- Cloudflare Workers + D1 (Drizzle), Hono API, React + Vite + Tailwind.
- Bun for packages and scripts (`bun`/`bunx`, never npm/npx). Node LTS.
- TypeScript strict, ESM (`import`/`export`) everywhere.
- Secrets only via env (`.env` locally — gitignored, `wrangler secret` in
  prod). Keep `.env.example` updated when adding a key.
- One root `.gitignore`; every entry gets a `#` rationale comment.

## Status

**Phase: building.** Milestones 1 (scaffold + walking skeleton) and 2 (domain
schema D17–D19, workspace load endpoint D20, TanStack Query client store D21
with the optimistic-mutation template in `src/client/store.ts`) complete
2026-06-11. Milestone 3 (real views: issue page D22, global "My Work" board
D23, container pages) and milestone 4 (issue creation + movement with key
aliases D24, command palette + keyboard map D25 — `src/client/commands/`)
complete 2026-06-12. Milestone 5 (CRUD gaps, D26–D27: container
create/edit/archive, tags with auto-color, arc/title editing, T/A keyboard
pickers) complete 2026-06-12. Milestone 6 (GitHub webhook magic-word
PR/commit linking, D29 — HMAC-verified endpoint, alias-aware key
resolution, PR/commit display; local secret in `.dev.vars`) complete
2026-06-12. Milestone 7 mobile pass complete (D30: touch drag via
hold-delay sensor, phone-viewport verified). **Deployed to production
2026-06-12**: <https://progress.bryan-22c.workers.dev> (D1 migrated +
dogfood-seeded, webhook secret set, live endpoints verified — see
`docs/SETUP.md` §6). Cloudflare Access live 2026-06-12 (owner-only
Allow + webhook-path Bypass, verified — `docs/SETUP.md` §6). **Dogfood
cutover complete 2026-06-16 (D32): v1 is done** — Progress's backlog now
lives in Progress (22 issues across 3 arcs, run through the Access service
token via `scripts/dogfood-cutover.ts`). Same day, fixed a production
`/api/workspace` 500 (D31: 9-statement read `db.batch` → `Promise.all`, plus
an `app.onError` that logs real exceptions to `wrangler tail`). Remaining v1
hookup is owner-side only: GitHub webhook registration on connected repos.
Now building **v1.x agent integration**. Context bundle endpoint
`GET /api/issues/:key/bundle` shipped (PROG-17, D33). **Progress MCP server
shipped (PROG-18, D34)**: `src/mcp/server.ts` (`bun run mcp`), a local stdio
MCP server wrapping the API with the Access service token — seven
key-addressed tools (get_bundle / get_issue / list_issues / create_issue /
update_status / comment / move_issue); registration in `docs/SETUP.md` §7.
Next brick: the outbound "Work on this" kickoff (PROG-19, SPEC §11.2) plus
the thin "copy as prompt" button. `bun run dev`
serves everything on :8000
(see `docs/SETUP.md`). Shared wire types live in `src/shared/`. Synthetic
5k-issue data: `bun run db:seed:scale`; reset via `docs/SETUP.md` §2. Update
this section as phases change.
